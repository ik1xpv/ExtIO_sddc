terms of this Agreement and any applicable open source license agreement.
If you do not agree to these terms and the applicable open source terms,
promptly return all software items (disks, written materials and packaging)
to Cypress or the place of purchase and destroy all electronic copies.
This Agreement covers your rights and responsibilities with regard to the
contents of the Technical Package, which may include one or more of the
following: Cypress firmware ("Firmware"), Cypress operating system drivers
("Drivers"), and Cypress application software ("Application Software").
The Firmware, Drivers, and/or the Application Software may be provided in
