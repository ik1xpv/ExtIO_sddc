Initial version

## Build Instructions for ExtIO

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 with Visual C++ support. You can use the free community version, which can be downloaded from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
1. Install CMake 3.19+, https://cmake.org/download/
1. Running the following commands in your cloned repro:

```bash
> cd ExtIO_sddc
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> cmake --build .
```

* You need to download **32bit version** of fftw library from fftw website http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html. Copy libfftw3f-3.dll from the downloaded zip package to the same folder of extio DLL.

* If you are running **64bit** OS, you need to run the following different commands instead of "cmake .." based on your Visual Studio Version:
```
VS2019: >cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32
VS2017: >cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win32"
VS2015: >cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win32"
```

## Build Instructions for firmware

- download latest Cypress EZ-USB FX3 SDK from here: https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/ez-usb-fx3-software-development-kit
- follow the installation instructions in the PDF document 'Getting Started with FX3 SDK'; on Windows the default installation path will be 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Cypress\EZ-USB FX3 SDK\1.3' (see pages 17-18) - on Linux the installation path could be something like '/opt/Cypress/cyfx3sdk'
- add the following environment variables:
```
export FX3FWROOT=<installation path>
export ARMGCC_INSTALL_PATH=<ARM GCC installation path>
export ARMGCC_VERSION=4.8.1
```
(on Linux you may want to add those variables to your '.bash_profile' or '.profile')
- all the previous steps need to be done only once (or when you want to upgrade the version of the Cypress EZ-USB FX3 SDK)
- to compile the firmware run:
```
cd SDDC_FX3
make
```
